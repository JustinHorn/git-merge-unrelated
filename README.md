## Git-Merge-Unrelated

When you want to join several old repositories into a new one while keeping the original commits use this tool to merge them.

I used it for https://github.com/JustinHorn/websiteAndApps and https://github.com/JustinHorn/small_scripts

### How to set up?

1. git clone git@github.com:JustinHorn/git-merge-unrelated.git
2. cd git-merge-unrelated
3. npm i -g .
4. use it empty repos with atleast 1 commit

### Information Regarding it's use:

- the repo needs to have atleast one commit for it to properly work
- the root folder should only contain folders of other projects
- there should be no staged files
